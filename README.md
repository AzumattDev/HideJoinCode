# Description

##  Quick and dirty mod that I made to hide the join code of the server you're connected to inside of the Game Menu when using crossplay. Requested by a videogame streamer.


#### Server

`This mod is not needed on a server. It's client only. Install on each client that you wish to have the mod load.`

As long as the dll ends up in your BepInEx\plugins folder, you're good to go. If you're using a mod manager please make
sure that it's inside the mod profile's version of that folder.

`Feel free to reach out to me on discord if you need manual download assistance.`
